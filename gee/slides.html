# Introduction to Google Earth Engine

 - **What?** GIS platform to access, process and analyse RS data. Google giving us amazing stuff for free.
 - **Why?** Easy access to a lot of data plus free cloud resources.
 - **How?** It's the rest of the slides

---

class: inverse, center, middle
name: setup

# Initial setup

---

# Initial setup

Course requirements:

- Basic understanding of GIS concepts
- Basic programming knowledge

Setup:
 - Google account
 - Google Drive

class: inverse, center, middle
name: rs-basics

# Remote sensing basics

---

# Remote sensing basics

 - Raster data
 - Light physics stuff
 - How satellites work
 - Spatial and temporal resolution

 <!--
[RM] For light physics stuff, could include how NDVI is made, then just list
out a bunch of other indices that can be created (beyond course to go in depth
for other indices, but good to show NDVI because so popular then good to know
that others exist)
# https://custom-scripts.sentinel-hub.com/
 -->

 <!--
[RM] Maybe we do a slide either here or when we talk about the data catalogue
# that describes some of the more popular satellite imagery sources with
# some super basic info about them. Maybe like:

# DAYTIME IMAGERY

| Source      | Resolution | Time Period | Capture imagery every... | N bands |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------------------------ | ------- |
| Landsat     | 30m         | 1970s- | 2ish weeks             | 8ish?   |
| Sentinel    | 10m         | 2015/7?- | 2ish weeks           | 8ish?   |
| MODIS       | 500m         | 2000-        | Daily      | XX |

See resolution vs. capture frequency trade off (MODIS vs landsat/sentinel)

# NIGHTTIME Imagery

| Source      | Resolution | Time Period | Capture imagery every... |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| DMSP-OLS     | 1km         | 1992-2013 | Annual             |
| VIIRS     | 750m         | 2012- | Monthly            |

Or I think both capture daily, but annual / monthly is what GEE provides

# Code Editor and APIs

# Code Editor and APIs

 - Explain that there are different APIs, but we will focus on JS
 - Code editor interface

class: inverse, center, middle
name: data

# Loading data

---

# Loading data

 - Data catalog
 - Uploading your own data

# JavaScript and basic operations

---

# JavaScript and basic operations

 - JS syntax
 - Defining variables and functions
 - Debugging (printing objects and metadata)

---
class: inverse, center, middle
name: data-processing

# Data processing

---

# Data processing

 - Aggregation
 - Clip

<!--
If time, could also show:
- Aggregation taking into account cloud cover (ie, avoiding areas with clouds when aggregating)
But at least should mention that often need to consider cloud cover when aggregating
- Raster math - maybe make NDVI out of landsat and add NDVI as a band? But may be too much.
Also NDVI is often precomputed within GEE.

But can see how long things end up being. Staying more basic and just showing
how to aggregate, clip and export imagery during this session would be super good.

<!--
# [RM]
We can think more about whether something like this would be useful (we briefly)
discussed when we met). But we can think about making some sort of collection
of useful scripts, and go over these at the end. Maybe worth us thinking about
what scripts would be most useful - but could do scripts for:
- Downloading monthly VIIRS
- Downloading annual VIIRS
- Downloading annual DMSP-OLS
- Downloading NDVI from landsat
- Downloading NDVI from MODIS
- Downloading weather data (precipitation / temperature)

So kinda the goal of this training will be to:
1. Teach people about GEE, so they can do basic stuff on their own
2. Advertise existing resources, so with this training people should at least
be comfortable using some pre-packaged scripts that we create

Here's a super unorganized collection of a bunch of scripts I've made, but we
can create a separate github repo or something, or thing about some way to
share some resouces: https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/robmarty3/ieConnectGEE

Maybe one thing to think about is creating a set of functions for aggregating/clipping
VIIRS/DMSP/NDVI for a country, then seeing if there's a way to source these functions
into GEE from a github repo.
